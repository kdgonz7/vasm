= Macros

== What are macros?

Macros are essentially compile-time statements. These statements have no awareness of even the root source code but simply serve as a way for the program to control how it gets compiled.

== Syntax

[source,asm]
[Ident *Args...]

[source, asm]
[compat nexfuse] ; specify this program compiling with NexFUSE.
