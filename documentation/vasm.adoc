== Name

vasm - A compiler for the OpenLUD, NexFUSE, SolarisVM, and JADE VMs.

== Synopsis

vasm [FILE ...] [OPTIONS ...]

== Description

A standard compiler for LR Assembly, a weakly typed assembler language designed
to be compatible with multiple VM environments.

== Options

*-h --help*::
  Shows this message
*--format, -f FORMAT*::
Configures the format used in the binary. The format defines the instruction set used in the
compilation process. Binary sizes and bits are handled in this option. For example, selecting
the **openlud** option will automatically create an 8-bit vendor instead of truncating
a 32-bit one. See **VENDORS** for more information.

*-O<N>*::
Defines the optimization level for the compiler. This option has an effect on the output binary.
  * *O0*
    * No optimizations.
  * *O1*
    * Adds peephole optimizations such as dead code elimination.
  * *O2*
    * Forcibly quitting after an empty procedure, and optimizing code as its written instead of after its wrote.

== Vendors

A "vendor" is defined as information to help generate binaries based on documented instructions sets. Instead of mapping each instruction to a number, vasm supports generation of binaries through hand-implemented functions which are children of instructions.
