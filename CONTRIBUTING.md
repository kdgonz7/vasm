# Contributing to VASM

Thank you for choosing to contribute to the VASM Compiler! As the codebase for the VOLT assembler grows, there 
will be more and more that needs to be maintained and tested throughout the project's lifetime. 

VASM is currently built with Zig `0.14.0-dev.1671+085cc54aa`. Overtime 
this number will change and features will. It is important to stay on top of this number.

## Tips

* Always run and create tests, make sure your changes are scalable and stable
* Create and use `*Result` types when more than an error union is needed.
