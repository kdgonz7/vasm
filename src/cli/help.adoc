Usage: vasm FILE [OPTIONS...]

-h, --help::
    Shows the help menu. Note: this is a work in progress and currently does not show anything on Windows devices because of execve being used to run `man`. As the frontend begins to become stabilized this will change.

--no-stylist::
    Disables running stylist when compiling a program. This disables any compile-time checks and also conflicts with the `--enforce-stylist` flag.

--strict | --enforce-stylist::
    Quits compilation early if stylist reports any style or potential UB issues. Useful for writing strictly typed LR assembly.

-ln, --allow-large-numbers::
    Allows for large numbers to be in the program. (disabling lex-time checks for large numbers)
    It is recommended to keep this option ON as it prevents UB from occuring within the program.

-le::
    Specifies the `endian` flag as *big* in the compiler's options. The endian flag controls the endianness of the binary generation.

-be::
    Specifies the `endian` flag as *little* in the compiler's options. The endian flag controls the endianness of the binary generation.

-f, --format FORMAT::
    Specifies the output format for the binary. This output format will be the basis for any operations moving forward. This format flag is converted from a string to an enum that contains the format's information. The format is used for

    * Lexer number sizes
    * Vendor sizes
    * Vendor name

-o, --output FILE::
    Specifies the output location of the binary. This location *must* be a file, it can not be a directory.

-O[N]::
Sets the optimization level to *N*. For some architectures this will have an effect on what context is chosen and passed to the generator, and others it may not.
